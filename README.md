# Duolingo-Streak-Saver
Simple automation script for lazy Duolingo users like me that automates login and a few clicks to continue your streak<br>

Read the Requirements file to check eligibility<br>

### How to run 

- Add your email and passoword to the instructed area in the code<br>
- Run the Duolingo.py file and keep the automated chrome window open till login and the rest will be done for you<br>

If you want other languages you can let me know or make a PR yourself adding a few sentences
